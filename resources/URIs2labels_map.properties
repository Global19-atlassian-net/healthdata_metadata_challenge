#The purpose of this file is to specify a map from URIs to the preferred rdfs:label for those URIs
#to be included for convenience in the newly proposed metadata.
#
#This Java property file contains key value pairs.
#The key contains all of the characters in the line starting with the first non-white space character and up to, 
#but not including, the first unescaped '=', ':', or white space character other than a line terminator. 
#All of these key termination characters may be included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash character.
#E.g. The key 'Variable Foo:Bar' needs to be entered as 'Variable\ Foo\:Bar'
